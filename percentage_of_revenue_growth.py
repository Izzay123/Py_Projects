# You are analyzing sales data from a ticket office.
# The ticket for an adult is $20, while the ticket for a child under 18 is $5.
# The data you are given is in a dictionary format, where the keys are the sold ticket numbers, and the values are the customer ages.
# For example, "123-08": 24 means that the ticket was bought a 24 year old.
# Your goal is to calculate how much more money the office would make if it would change the ticket discount age to the given input.
# So, your program needs to take an integer as input and output the percentage of revenue growth, if the discount was given to people under that age.
